# Cafe-Reviews
Find all cafes in a location and get their short description. Users can upload new cafes, or delete closed cafes with an API and API KEY. This is my practice project that uses SQLAlchemy for editing and updating the database and FLASK as its framework. Uses HTTP GET, POST, PUT/PATCH, and DELETE methods.
